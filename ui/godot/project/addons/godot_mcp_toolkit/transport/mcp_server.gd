## The editor-side MCP server — the transport orchestration facade.
##
## Constructs, wires, and drives the transport subsystems, keeping only the
## lifecycle and the cross-subsystem seams: ws_transport owns the TCP listener +
## WS peer accept/poll + auth-handshake framing, notifier owns notification
## framing/sends, server_request_router + dispatch_lane own request routing and
## lane dispatch, and scene_lease / mutation_watchdog / unfocused_sleep_controller
## / lsp_publisher own their domains. All command logic lives in per-domain
## modules under commands/.

signal client_connected(peer_count: int)
signal client_disconnected(peer_count: int)
signal command_received(method: String)
## Emitted when the MCP server reports a new GDScript LSP verdict
## (set_reported_lsp_status) so the dock refreshes exactly on change — no polling,
## no stale label even if the status is re-assessed later (e.g. on an LSP call).
signal lsp_status_changed
## Emitted after the session token is re-written to a new user:// path following a
## user-path change, carrying that new token path. The plugin (registry lifecycle
## owner) re-publishes the entry via ensure_registered, which preserves any active
## runtime_port/runtime_pid — register would null them and break Mode-B discovery
## for a game running across the rename.
signal token_rewritten(token_path: String)
## Emitted when the listen state changes — a fresh bind, a listen conflict
## (pinned port occupied / scan band exhausted / lost rebind) raised or cleared,
## or a port-config error. The dock re-reads get_port_warning() + the listening
## state and repaints. Immediate counterpart to the dock's own refresh pull.
signal port_status_changed
## Emitted on a fresh listener bind (initial, or late — e.g. a pinned port that
## frees after a startup conflict), carrying the bound port. The composition root
## (re)publishes the registry entry on it, so the actual bound port lands in
## projects.json in every mode — the ground truth the server's desync cross-check
## reads.

# APIs that use the progress dialog (e.g. save_scene) log benign
# progress_dialog.cpp errors. This is acceptable — the alternative
